<dd><p>kepsff – remove motion-correlated noise from aperture light curve data</p>
<p>The systematic noise within aperture-constructed K2 photometry is dominated
by the effects of boresight roll under the force of solar pressure. Roll is
minimized by orienting the spacecraft in pointing directions that minimize
spacecraft structure asymmetry normal to the Sun-vector and compensated for
over campaign durations by regular thruster firings, typically every 6
hours. kepsff provides an open source python implementation of the
photometric correction for K2 motion systematics provided by Vanderburg and
Johnson (2014).The method will also work upon archived Kepler data and
provides a relatively-simple and CPU-friendly alternative to cotrending
against basis-vector derived ensemble photometry (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepcotrend</span></code>),
pixel-level principal component analysis (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keppca</span></code>), and PSF fitting
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepprfphot</span></code>). As well, as computational speed, this method has the
advantage of requiring no external data in order to perform corrections.
All required data is extracted from individual Kepler light curves stored
at the archive, or K2 light curves constructed from archived target pixel
files using the kepextract task. In the example figure above, the 12th
magnitude target, EPIC 202093219, has a median 6.5-hour standard deviation
of 60 parts-per-million (according to the tool kepstddev. After motion
correction using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepsff</span></code>, this quantity is reduced to 36 parts-per-million.</p>
<p>The name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepsff</span></code> is derived from “Self-Flat-Fielding” (SFF) and is
propagated from the Vanderburg and Johnson (2014) paper. However the name
is somewhat misleading because the effects corrected for in the K2 case are
dominated by aperture losses and source crowding rather than flat-field
variations. In essence, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepsff</span></code> corrects motion-induced
aperture-photometry artifacts after constructing a position-flux relation
from a detrended (astrophysics-removed) version of the light curve. This
tool will find most-employment upon K2 data, especially in the early
mission phases when the data archives will contain calibrated target pixel
files but no light curves. However, in line with the philosophy of the PyKE
tools, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepsff</span></code> provides the user with a degree of customization to meet
the demands of a broad range of target types and science goals. The
long-term goal is to provide Kepler and K2 users with a range of reduction
options and this tool is part of that software kit. Also, in line with the
PyKE philosophy, these algorithms, as coded, are not perfect. We recommend
and welcome tinkering and further development by the community in order to
make these tools better. This case is also precisely what the K2 community
requires in the sense that the archive users, here Andrew Vanderburg and
John Johnson, are seeking solutions to their own data reduction needs,
becoming self-sufficient, and reporting their findings and methods to us
all.</p>
<p>Preparation work is required before kepsff can provide a good correction.
First, a light curve needs to be extracted a from Target Pixel File
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepextract</span></code>) using a user-customized pixel aperture defined within
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepmask</span></code>. The resulting light curve also needs to be detrended, i.e. the
astrophysics needs to be removed as much as possible (kepflatten) in order
for the correction to be as precise as possible. Note that the astrophysics
is not removed permanently, but care has to be taken to prepare the data
this way before confidence in the correction can be built for individual
light curves on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>The name of an input light curve FITS file. This file needs to contain
a minimum set of information: Mid-exposure times, cadence numbers,
simple-aperture flux, moment-derived and/or PSF-derived target
centroids, quality flags and Kepler standard keywords. All of these
properties are provided in archived light curves from the Kepler
mission, but need to be calculated for the K2 mission. The PyKE tool
kepextract calculates all these properties and provides an input file
suitable for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kepsff</span></code>. In addition, the input file also requires a
column of detrended data, where long-term astrophysics and
orbit-related systematics have been removed. The PyKE tool kepflatten
performs this pre-step, producing a FITS column of detrended data (at
low-frequencies) called DETSAP_FLUX.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>outfile</strong> : str</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The name of the output light curve FITS file. This file has the same
structure as the input file with three content changes. The aperture
photometry, DETSAP_FLUX, and detrended photometry, DETSAP_FLUX are
corrected for motion-correlated noise. The quality flag column,
SAP_QUALITY, includes a new bit-flag of value 131072 that identifies
exposures collected during on-board thruster firings, typically
occurring on a 6-hr cadence.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>datacol</strong> : str</p>
<blockquote>

low-frequency structure removed). If the input file is a product of
kepflatten then this column is named DETSAP_FLUX.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>cenmethod</strong> : str</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>kepsff requires target position data on the CCD detector in order to
correlate spacecraft boresight motion with systematic signal within the
flux time-series. The typical Kepler/K2 light curve files have
place-holders for two different measures of source centroid:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">moments</span></code> – center-of-light within the pixel aperture
(alternatively known as the zeroth-moment of the flux distribution
over the pixels). These two arrays, the X and Y centroid over time,
are stored in FITS columns MOM_CENTR1 and MOM_CENTR2.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">psf</span></code> – the PSF-fitting method, the X and Y locations of best-fit
PSF models to the aperture pixels. These are rarely available within
archived Kepler data but can be stored in PSF_CENTR1 and PSF_CENTR2.
Both sets of centroids are provided in the output from kepextract,
where the moments data is generally preferred over the PSF data which
derives from the simplifying assumptions that sources are not
confused and are well-characterized by symmetric Gaussian profiles.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>stepsize</strong> : float [days]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ultimately, kepsff will construct a time-series of flux-correction
factors based upon a correlation curve between spacecraft boresight
motion and aperture-flux variation. Perhaps due to differential
velocity aberration, this calibration is not stable over time. The
somewhat clunky solution to this in the current version of the tool is
re-calibrate the correlation and apply the subsequent correction over a
series of discrete time windows. stepsize identifies the length of
these windows in units of days. Some trial and error is required to
optimize light curve correction. Window sizes of 4-6 days often provide
the optimal correction, but astrophysical structure on these timescales
can lead the user to adopt longer or shorter step sizes in order to
reduce the unwanted impact of astrophysics on the correction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>npoly_cxcy</strong> : int</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There is a sequence of four polynomial fits required to characterize
and filter the input data in order to produce a flux-motion correlation
curve. The following sequence of fit parameters is therefore quite
dis-orienting until some familiarity is gained with hands-on
experience. The diagnostic plots, provided when plot=True provide
significant help here with the four fits delivered in the four
left-most panels (figure 1). The first fit is to the centroid
coordinates selected by cenmethod. These data points are provided in
the top-left panel of the figure and generally trace very-close to a
linear path across the detector. Fine-point motion is dominated by roll
around the boresight and therefore small-angle, near-linear behavior is
unsurprising. The two black lines represent the eigenvectors of the
covariance matrix of the centroids. These eigenvectors are used to
rotate the centroid distribution so that the direction of motion (x’)
is aligned to the x-axis of the rotated system. The rotation
functionality requires user-optimization in one aspect. Obvious
outliers need to be removed from the sample before the eigenvectors are
calculated. We achieve this iterative sigma-clipping. The user defines
the order of a polynomial fit (1st order is recommended) and a
threshold distance from the best fit where data points outside that
threshold are removed before the remaining data are re-fit. Iterations
continue until no additional data points are rejected. The rejection
threshold is provided by the argument sigma_cxcy. Points lying below
the rejection threshold are plotted as green symbols whereas data
points rejected by this process will be plotted red. In the example
above, no data points are rejected. The most likely cause of outliers
is data obtained while the spacecraft is not guiding on reference
stars. We predict such occasions to be rare during optimal operations,
but such observations were common during the engineering tests,
including the first half of campaign 0.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>sigma_cxcy</strong> : float [sigma]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Threshold for rejecting centroid data. The threshold is the number of
1-sigma standard deviation distances from the best-fit. Points further
from the best-fit than the threshold provided will be considered
unrepresentative of the flux-motion correlation that the tool is
attempting to characterize. These points are not thrown away, they are
corrected in the final calculation with the rest of the data, but they
play no further part in the calibration of the correlation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>npoly_ardx</strong> : int</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Step 2 (top-middle panel) is the determination of the relatively small
deviation of centroid motion from linear. Here, in the rotated frame,
we fit a high-order polynomial to the centroid data filtered and
rotated in the first step. The green curve is the integrated path
length along that curve (s) minus the linear term. The calculation is
provided by equation 4 of Vanderburg and Johnson (2014). The red curve
is a polynomial fit to the integral which subsequently allows us to
cheaply calculate the absolute motion of the centroids relative to
linear location along the dominant eigenvector in the unrotated frame.
Producing a ‘fit of a fit’ is somewhat inelegant and open source
developers could be challenged here to add some additional
mathematical rigor to this step. However this section of the
calculation has, so far, not proved to be critical - the path length
integral is very close to linear, so cleaning this calculation up is
low-priority currently.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>npoly_dsdt</strong> : int</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The third step (lower-left panel) is a prescription to filter out
exposures collected during thruster firings. Firing occur typically on
a 6-hr cadence and occur when the spacecraft has rolled far enough to
trigger a pointing adjustment. These data cannot be corrected using the
current method. They are flagged here so that they do not bias the
motion-flux correlation calculation and so that they can be documented
within the quality flags of the output file. A low-order polynomial is
fit to the time derivative along the path length (ds/dt) using 3-sigma
iterative clipping. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">npoly_dsdt</span></code> provides the user with flexibility
to choose the polynomial order. In the plot, the best fit is shown as a
red, solid line.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>sigma_dsdt</strong> : float [sigma]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is a threshold limit in units of 1-sigma standard deviation from
the best-fit. Data points falling outside of the threshold are
more-likely-than-not collected during thruster firings. These points
are flagged in the SAP_QUALITY column of the output file with the bit
131072 and is not employed to calibrate the flux-motion relation. The
threshold curve is plot as a red, dashed line and rejected points are
colored red.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>npoly_arfl</strong> : int</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The fourth panel (lower-middle) provides the subsequent target motion
vs aperture flux distribution. The red line is polynomial fit, the
order of which is chosen by the user here. Iterative
<span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>-clipping is again required - the many outliers below
the best-fit are astrophysical in nature (binary star eclipses) and
would bias the fit if they were unrecognized or simply allowed to.
The user has flexibility to change the order and clipping threshold
in order to provide the most robust fit and there is a degree of
objectivity in this process. A low polynomial is generally adequate,
this example employs a 3rd order function.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>sigma_arfl</strong> : float [sigma]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is the threshold limit in units of 1-sigma standard deviation from
the best-fit polynomial to the motion-flux relation. Data points
falling outside of the threshold are in effect rejected from the
calibration. Such points potentially contain astrophysical signal that
would both bias the calculation and damp the astrophysical signal
within the data after the correction has been made. The best-fit red
line provides the correction factors within the data window. For each
point along the aperture-derived flux curve (upper-right), the position
along the arc can be calculated and the multiplicative correction
factor to the flux can determined directly from the best-fit
motion-flux relation. The subsequent corrected light curve is provided
lower-right on the same plotting scale as above. The red points are
those flagged as potential thruster firing and their 6-hr cadence
suggests these events have generally been flagged well.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>plot</strong> : bool</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If true, diagnostic plots identical to figure 1 above will be rendered
