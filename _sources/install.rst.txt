Installation

Requirements
============

PyKE has the following requirements, all of which tend to be available by
default in a modern installation of Python:

- Python: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 or later.
- Astropy: 1.3 or later.
- Numpy: 1.11.3 or later.
- Scipy: 0.17 or later.
- Matplotlib: 1.5.3 or later.

We strongly recommend using the `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_
distribution, which will install Python alongside its most common scientific
packages, including all those listed above.



Installing PyKE
===============

Stable version
--------------

The easiest way to install or upgrade PyKE is with ``pip``, simply run the
following command on a terminal window::

    $ pip install pyketools --upgrade --no-deps


.. note::

    The ``--no-deps`` flag is optional, but highly recommended if you already
    have Numpy installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to upgrade
    your Numpy installation, which may not always be desired.

.. note::

    If you get a ``PermissionError`` this means that you do not have the
    required administrative access to install new packages to your Python
    installation.  In this case you may consider using the ``--user`` option
    to install the package into your home directory.  You can read more
    about how to do this in the `pip documentation
    <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.2.1/other-tools.html#using-pip-with-the-user-scheme>`_.


Development version
-------------------

Alternatively, if you want to experiment with the latest development version of
PyKE, you can install it straight from GitHub::

    $ git clone https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE.git
    $ cd PyKE
    $ pip install -e .


Building documentation
======================

.. note::

    In general, building the documentation is not necessary unless you are
    writing new documentation or do not have internet access, because the
    latest (and archive) versions of PyKE's documentation should be available
    at `pyke.keplerscience.org/ <http://pyke.keplerscience.org/>`_ .

.. note::
    PyKE documentation requires the `numpydoc sphinx extension <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_
    which can be installed with ``pip install numpydoc``.

To build the documentation to HTML format, you can do::

    cd docs
    make html

The documentation will be built in the ``docs/build/html`` directory, and can
be read by pointing a web browser to ``docs/build/html/index.html``.
